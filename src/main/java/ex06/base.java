 *  Exercise 6 - Retirement Calculator
 *  Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the
 *  year you can retire. It should prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire and display
 *  the output as shown in the example that follows.
 *
 *  Constraint:
 *  Again, be sure to convert the input to numerical data before doing any math.
 *  Donâ€™t hard-code the current year into your program. Get it from the system time via your programming language.
